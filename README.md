   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Apply database migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Create a superuser:
   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. Run the development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
